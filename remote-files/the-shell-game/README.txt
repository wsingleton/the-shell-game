Welcome to The Shell Game! This is a simple and interactive shell-based game to help you get used to the command line and learn common Unix commands and even a little Bash! Let's get started, by introducing you to the commands you need to know. If you have made it this far you must already be at least a little tech savvy. To review, the commands you probably know at this point are:

    - ssh: you used this one to connect to this remote server, you likely provided a key using the -i flag
    - cd: you used this one to move into the directory that you are in now
    - ls: you used this one to see the contents of a particular directory (probably how you found this file)
    - cat: you used this one to read this file, it reads data from a file and con-cat-enates (get it?) its contents to the standard output (stdout)

In this game we will refer to directories as "rooms". In the next room you will find a task file called `task0.txt` that you should read, it will give you instruction on what to do next so that you can proceed.
